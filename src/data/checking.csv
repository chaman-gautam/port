Phase,Feature / Task,Description & Details from Docs,Team Member,Task Breakdown
Setup,Repository & Tech Stack,Finalize the complete tech stack and project structure.,All,"Decide on: Git workflow, React Native + Expo for frontend, Flask for backend, SQLite for DB. Create GitHub repo."
Setup,Figma Design System,"Create a high-fidelity design system based on the provided style guide (colors, fonts, components).",Design Lead,"Define all styles in Figma/Canva. Create components for buttons, cards, progress circles. Share with team."
Setup,Backend Skeleton,Set up the basic Flask server and define initial API endpoints.,Backend Lead,"Initialize Flask app. Create placeholder endpoints: `POST /analyze/speech`, `GET /user/progress`."
Setup,Frontend Skeleton,Set up the React Native app and basic navigation between empty screens.,Frontend Lead,"Run `expo init`. Install navigation library. Create empty screens: Onboarding, Dashboard, Lesson, Feedback."
Core,Onboarding & Skill Selection,"A user selects their chosen domain (speaking, coding, fitness).",Frontend Lead,Build the onboarding screen with 3 large buttons for each coach. Save selection to AsyncStorage.
Core,Dashboard & Progress Tracking,Tracks your progress over time. Visual Progress Tracking.,Frontend Lead; Backend Lead,"FE: Build UI with progress circle, points, leaderboard link. BE: Create `progress` DB table. Create `GET /progress` API to fetch user data."
Core,Real-Time Feedback (The Wow Factor),"Real-time Feedback: AI checks voice clarity, tone, filler words, body posture (via webcam).",All,1. FE: Build Lesson screen with `expo-camera` and record button. 2. BE: Create `POST /analyze/speech` API to receive video. 3. AI: Write `analyze_speech()` function to transcribe audio and count filler words. 4. BE: Return JSON with score & feedback. 5. FE: Build Feedback screen to display results beautifully.
Core,Adaptive Learning Path,Continuously reshapes your learning path like a real tutor.,Backend Lead; AI Lead,"Implement a simple rule engine. E.g., IF score < 70, recommend 'practice more,' ELSE recommend 'next lesson.' Store 'level' in user profile."
Core,Gamification,"Daily challenges, streaks, progress charts. AI rivals.",Frontend Lead; Backend Lead,"FE: Add points display, badge icons, a leaderboard screen. BE: Create `users` table with `points` and `streak` columns. Create `GET /leaderboard` API."
Core,Focus Mode,App restriction feature... Block distracting applications.,Frontend Lead,Build a timer screen using `setInterval`. It's a UI feature for the demo (true app blocking is complex).
Advanced,Skill Simulations,Mock interviews with AI. Debate/negotiation practice with AI persona.,AI Lead; Frontend Lead,AI: Create a simple text-based Q&A script for a mock interview. FE: Build a simple chat interface that displays these questions and records text answers.
Advanced,Cross-Domain Support,Can switch between different 'skill coaches'.,Frontend Lead,"Add a menu on the dashboard to change the selected skill coach, updating the main UI."

Presentation,Slide Deck,Create a compelling pitch deck that tells the story.,Design Lead,"Build slides covering: Problem, Solution, Tech Architecture, Key Features (use doc screenshots!), Demo, Future."
Presentation,Demo Script & Narrative,Building the Future of Learning. Plan a compelling live demo.,Design Lead; All,Write a script. Assign speaking parts. Plan the exact demo flow. Practice timing (max 3-4 mins).
Presentation,Live Demo Preparation,Ensure the demo works flawlessly.,All,Do a full dry run. Have a pre-recorded video as a backup. Charge devices. Connect to stable WiFi.
Presentation,Q&A Preparation,Prepare for judges' questions.,All,"Each member prepares answers for their domain. Backend ready to explain APIs, AI ready to explain heuristics, etc."
